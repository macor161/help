<h1>Aragon Court Dashboard</h1>

<h4 id="connecting-to-dashboard"><a href="#connecting-to-dashboard">1. Connecting to the Dashboard</a></h4>
<p>
	 By default, the Dashboard is accessible to all users. General information and statistics are available on the main page as well as more specific information related to disputes, tasks, and jurors in their respective page. However, it is when the app is connected to an Ethereum account that it really comes alive and offer its full potential.
</p>

<p>
	In order to connect your Ethereum account to the Aragon Court Dashboard, simply click on the "Enable account" button at the upper right and select the provider of your choice.

<h4 id="balances"><a href="#balances">2. Balances</a></h4>
<p>
	<img src="img/dashboard-balances.png">
</p>
<p>
	The first section you will see at the top of the Dashboard contains your ANJ balance information. This section is divided into three columns: <strong>My wallet</strong>, <strong>Inactive</strong> and <strong>Active</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>My wallet</strong> shows the amount of ANJ that your Ethereum wallet currently contains and its relative value in US dollars. Those tokens are not being managed by the Court and are at any given time fully under your control. To activate them and increase your chances of being drafted as a juror, you can click the <strong>Activate</strong> button at the bottom of the section and a side panel will appear asking for the amount of ANJ that you want to activate. The amount will be transferred to the <strong>Active</strong> section once the transaction is executed.
	<br />
	If you don't own any ANJ tokens, you can click the <strong>Buy ANJ</strong> button at the top right of the dashboard. <a href="anj-token.html">Click here</a> to learn more about the various ways to obtain ANJ.
</p>
<p>
	The second column contains your inactive ANJ balance along with its value in US dollars. Inactive ANJ is held in the Court contract but doesn't increase your probability of being drafted. Two actions are available when you have an inactive balance: 
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Withdraw: </strong>Will withdraw a portion of the inactive ANJ to your wallet.</li>
		<li><strong>Activate: </strong>Will activate a portion of the inactive ANJ and transfer it to the <strong>Active</strong> section.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	The third column contains your active ANJ tokens. Active tokens serve three main purposes:
	<ul>
		<li>They determine your probability of being drafted as a juror. The higher the amount, the higher the probability.</li>
		<li>Subscription rewards are directly proportional to active tokens. <a href="#rewards">Click here</a> to learn more about the different types of rewards.</li>
		<li>In order to incentivize consensus decisions and honest behaviors, a portion of your active ANJ is staked when drafted for a dispute and you can get rewarded or penalized depending on the final ruling. <a href="disputes.html">Click here</a> to learn more about disputes.</li>
	</ul>
	The <strong>Deactivate</strong> button can be used to transfer ANJ tokens to an inactive state.
</p>

<p>Each column contains its own history of recent transactions.</p>

<p>Finally, at the top of the section, you can see in real-time your probabilty of being drafted as a juror. This probability takes into account the number of disputes and their current state.</p>

<h4 id="tasks"><a href="#tasks">3. Tasks</a></h4>
<p>
	<img src="img/dashboard-tasks.png">
</p>
<p>
	The Aragon Court requires certain tasks to be executed at various points in the life-cycle of a dispute. Some of them can be executed by anyone while others are strictly assigned to specific accounts. You can quickly see every task assigned to you along with their due date in the <strong>Upcoming Tasks</strong> section of the main page. A page dedicated to tasks is also available by clicking the <strong>Tasks</strong> menu item in the left side panel.
</p>
<p>If you are concerned about missing important tasks, don't worry, email notifications will be sent to you.</p>
	
<p>
  The following list contains every task you may encounter:
</p>

<p><strong>Draft jury:</strong> This task must be executed at the beginning of a round to select the jurors. Anyone can execute this task by clicking on the "Draft jury" button of the dispute. A small DAI reward is granted for successfully executing the task.
</p>

<p><strong>Commit vote:</strong> One of the most important tasks in the Aragon Court. When a juror is drafted to adjudicate a dispute, their duty is to review the submitted evidences and commit a vote within the voting period limit. Failure to execute this action would penalize the juror. <a href="disputes.html#voting-period">Click here</a> for more information about commiting votes.
</p>

<p><strong>Reveal vote:</strong> Since votes are secret until the end of the voting period, a task is also needed in order for the ruling to be unveiled. However, an option is available to make this task fully automated. <a href="disputes.html#voting-period">Click here</a> to learn more about it.</p>

<p><strong>Appeal ruling:</strong> Once the ruling is revealed, it can be appealed by anyone who disagree with its result. Be aware that you need to stake an amount of DAI to appeal a ruling. You will get rewarded if the ruling ends up turning in your favor at the end of the dispute. Learn more about appeals <a href="disputes.html#appeal">here</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>Confirm appeal:</strong> To officially appeal a ruling and launch a new adjudication round, a second account also needs to stake an amount of DAI to confirm that there is indeed a need for an appeal. Learn more about appeal confirmation <a href="disputes.html#appeal">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Execute ruling:</strong> If no appeal has been requested and confirmed within their respective periods of time, the "Execute ruling" task is available to finalize the dispute. <a href="disputes.html#ruling">Click here</a> to learn more about final rulings.
</p>


<h4 id="rewards"><a href="#rewards">4. Rewards</a></h4>
<p>
	<img src="img/dashboard-rewards.png">
</p>

<p>Rewards can be obtained in multiple ways, both as a juror and as a normal user.</p>

<p>
	<strong>As a juror:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Subscription fees:</strong> You earn a monthly reward, in DAI, proportional to your active ANJ stake, whether you are drafted or not.
		<li><strong>Dispute fees:</strong> If drafted, you earn a 10 DAI reward for ruling in favor of the dispute's final ruling. 
		</li>
		<li><strong>Slashed jurors fees:</strong> The amount slashed from jurors who voted against the consensus is redistributed to the other jurors.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	<strong>As a normal user:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Maintenance actions fees:</strong> Certain tasks (e.g. draft jury, execute ruling) rewards the user with a small amount of DAI.</li>
		<li><strong>Appeal Fees: </strong> Anyone can earn a reward, in DAI, for successfully appealing a dispute (i.e. correctly predicting a dispute's final ruling)</li>
	</ul>
</p>


<h4 id="disputes"><a href="#disputes">5. Disputes</a></h4>
